# Platformed
Platformed is an in depth platformer game with a fully functioning trigger system, built in level editor, online level sharing, built from the ground up in javascript.

## Level Editor
The level editor is probably the most powerful part of this project and has many features to help make designing levels easier. 

**Some Hightlights:**
- Fully functioning **Trigger System** that can change any block, teleport the player, or swap two different types of tiles
- The **selection box** allows you to pick up and move sections of tiles around the level, fill the selection, or delete it.
- Working **undo/redo** functionailty
- Test the level from within the level editor
- **Minimap** that you can use to move around

## Level Share
An online level share means you can share your creation with the world (or at least the internet). 

## The platformer
The platformer is complete with 3 different tilesets (16x16 being the most complete). It has **Spawn**, **Checkpoint**, **End**, **Trigger**, **Walljump**, functionalites, along with many more.

It also has mobile support, with a fullscreen mode for the level page and working mobile controls. If you want to connect a gamepad, that works too!

## Want some levels to play?

Here are some of the levels I've made over the course of this project:
- [Trigger Happy](https://platformed.jmeow.net/level/44) - a level showing off the extensive trigger system
- [Level 2](https://platformed.jmeow.net/level/28) - beware...
- [Part 1](https://platformed.jmeow.net/level/1) - just another level

# **High Priority**
- Trackpad moving around
  - two fingers move to move around the map
- walljump quickly floats up wall
- change my levels to login on level page
- add usernames to level browse 
- make it more obvious that a level is saved
- if the user isn't signed in, make ux so they can save their level
- allow resizing of the level (I already have a function for that)
- r key to respawn doesn't work anymore
- horizontal trampoline movement

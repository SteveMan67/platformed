# **High Priority**
- fix zooming
  - limit min zoom to editor height
  - add `ctrl+<scroll>`
- Add fill feature 
  - `f` when `selection.active` is true
- Trackpad moving around
  - two fingers move to move around the map

## Selection Stuff
- limit to map 
- add rotation to undo/redo
- apparently tiles other than 1 don't work?
